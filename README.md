# GunDuel
Futuristic Gun Duel Tournament at PPCG.SE

## Wrapper for external .exe binary

To make sure that your non-C++ player can communicate with the tournament manager, please compile your binary which will follow the rules in this snippet:

    Expected Command Line Argument Format:
    	<opponent-id> <turn> <status> <ammo> <ammo-opponent> <history> <history-opponent>

    Expected Return Code: The ascii value of a valid action character.
    	'0' = 48, '1' = 49, '2' = 50, '-' = 45, '=' = 61
    
    Player identifier is an integer in [0, N), where N is size of tournament.
    Turn is 0-based.
    If duel is in progress, status is 3.
    If duel is draw / won / lost, status is 0 / 1 / 2.
    If turn is 0, <history> and <history-opponent> are not provided.
    Histories are strings of actions, e.g. 002 0-=
    You can ignore arguments you don't particularly need.
